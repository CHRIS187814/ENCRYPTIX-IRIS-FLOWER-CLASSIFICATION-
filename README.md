# ENCRYPTIX-IRIS-FLOWER-CLASSIFICATION-
Overview

This project focuses on classifying iris flowers into three species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of sepal and petal length and width measurements for 150 samples.

Dataset

The dataset used is the Iris dataset, which is a well-known dataset in the field of pattern recognition. It contains:

150 samples

4 features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width

3 classes: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica

Installation

To set up the project, clone the repository and install dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-flower-classification.git
cd iris-flower-classification
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Run the main script to train and evaluate the model:

python main.py

Machine Learning Model

We use scikit-learn to train a classification model, employing algorithms such as:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Results

After training the models, we evaluate them using:

Accuracy Score

Confusion Matrix

Precision, Recall, and F1-score
